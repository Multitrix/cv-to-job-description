    RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND Skills:
    {json.dumps([item['text'] for item in relevant_info], indent=2)}
    
    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Format the CV to match EXACTLY the following structure:
       - Name at the top
       - Contact information (Portfolio, LinkedIn, Mobile Number, Github, Email) in two columns below the name
       - Sections in this order: Experience, Projects, Education, Publications (if relevant), Certifications, Extracurricular Activities (if relevant), Research Experience (if relevant), Skills
    
    2. For each experience and project:
       - Title and position on one line
       - Company/project details in italics on the next line (include location if available)
       - Bullet points for achievements and responsibilities
    
    3. Use bullet points (â€¢) for listing achievements, responsibilities, and skills
    
    4. In listing skills, use a structured format e.g.:
        Programming: Python, SQL,...
        Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch,...
        Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud AI,...
        Machine Learning Techniques: LLM Fine-tuning,...
        Dev Tools: Git, CI/CD,...
        .
        .
        .

    5. Only include information that is relevant to the job description
    
    6. Adapt the wording to align with the job description keywords without fabricating information
    
    7. Format the output as plain text with proper spacing and formatting that can be converted to PDF

    8. Output the CV and the CV only, no extra texts, no summary, no explanation, no comments, no code blocks, no markdown, no HTML, no LaTeX, just the CV in plain text format.
    
    9. IMPORTANT: For all links (certificates, portfolio, LinkedIn, etc.), use Markdown format: [Link Text](URL)
       For example: [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain)
       This ensures only the certificate name is visible and clickable in the final PDF.
